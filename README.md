# BLEND

## Summary

Defines averaging kernels with arbitrary support that is monotone in at least two dimensions for dimensions exceeding one. 

One major application is the smooth merging of multidimensional datasets defined on regular grids.

Example figure above shows a volume rendering of blending weights from cosine taper functions defined with an isotoxal star support that is invariant in the z-axis.
