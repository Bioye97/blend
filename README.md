# BLEND

## Summary

Plots averaging kernels on the support of arbitrary space. 

One major application is the smooth merging of multidimensional datasets defined on regular grids, like so:

Figure above shows a volume rendering of blending weights from a cosine taper function defined on the support of an isotoxal star that is invariant in the z-axis.
